# TransRest_API

A repo for Transgender Affirmations. 

## Genesis

The idea is a combination of a conversation about Transgender people needing to take a break and rest. 
The word association of rest is Restful API,
then Trans + Rest + API became TransRest_API.


## Data

The data is positive affirmations and neutral sayings regarding 
being Transgender. All affirmations are gender neutral so _everyone_
is included. The affirmations data is mostly in English, 
but you can help it have more than English.

## Data Guideline

Adding to the json file includes 

- affirmations that are gender neutral
- affirmations that can apply to most people on their Transgender journey

### Adding Persons

- any Transgender person who is publically known, has stated pronouns, their profession/ what they do and some fiction about how they will interact with the end user. 
- `profession` + `pronouns` + `fiction`

```
"Actress Laverne Cox (she/her) has a TV scene that mentions your blog"
```

### Adding Characters

You can add Transgender or GNC characters from TV shows/ films. 
Characters not formally Transgender but are considered Trans are 
accepted, example Star Trek Jadzia Dax. All characters needs to have the TV/film where the character is from. 

This section can have:

- basic info on the character
- fiction that includes the end user
- what this character does
- any superpowers this character has

- `(origin)` + `name` + `pronouns` + `option`

```
Star Trek Jadzia Dax (she/her) is a Trill species, which embodies other genders
```
